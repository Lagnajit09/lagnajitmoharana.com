        Back in my college days, I discovered my passion for coding and web
        development, diving headfirst into the world of full-stack development.
        Fast-forward to today, I've had the pleasure of working on various
        projects that showcase my skills in building responsive and interactive
        user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I focus on front-end development, creating visually appealing
        and user-friendly applications using technologies like React, Next.js,
        and Tailwind CSS. My technical toolkit also includes backend
        technologies such as Node.js and Firebase, enabling me to craft
        comprehensive full-stack solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical endeavors, I enjoy exploring the realms of
        2D animation, portrait drawing, and design. When I'm not coding, you'll
        find me bringing characters to life through animation, sketching
        intricate portraits, or brainstorming creative design ideas.
